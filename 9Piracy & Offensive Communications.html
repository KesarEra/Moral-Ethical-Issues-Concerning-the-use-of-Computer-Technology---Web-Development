	            <h1>Piracy & Offensive Communications</h1>
	            <p>With the internet software piracy has become a real issue. Major record labels, artists, film producers, authors etc charge far too much and are earning vast amounts of money for their work, which causes the arguments of freedom of access to arise. The top paid actors earn millions for a single film, but should people really be allowed to rip off artists. Everyone enjoys great movies and music and thousands of people work on them and rely on them for jobs even though it takes a long time to produce. Without the viewers’ and listeners’ money they wouldn't be making any money. More and more streaming sites are becoming popular, making it easy to pirate content.</p>
	        	<p>The internet has also become a great place for freedom of expression and as it provides anonymity, individuals are tempted into being more offensive and spread hurtful opinions, which they would never do face-to-face. Due too the popularity of social media sites and online forums, they can quickly become a place for spreading fear and hate. The term internet troll refers to a person who seeks to spark arguments online by posting abusive and offensive material.</p>

	            <h1>Environmental Effects</h1>
	            <p>Computers are made from some very toxic materials that need to be handled with great care when it comes to disposing old equipment. Computer technology waste includes airborne dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), cadmium, chromium, radioactive isotopes and mercury, which are very dangerous to humans as well as the environment. In some parts of the world, computers are considered hazardous waste, but they are often shipped off to countries with lower environmental standards. In some cases, children pick up the waste to extract materials that can be recycled or sold, exposing them to significant danger. While most modern computers consume low levels of electricity, most people often leave them running permanently. It is estimated that data centres use more energy than the aviation industry. The extraction of the raw materials, manufacturing of technology and the air conditioning associated with large installations makes computer technology a major consumer of energy.</p>

		            <ul>
		            	<li>The Chernobyl disaster can be considered the result of technological failure, leading to radioactive pollution in the whole city of Chernobyl, leaving it completely abandoned.</li>

		        			<ul>
				            	<li>The technology we have now can help us develop and produce new technologies that are sustainable and do not harm the environment, so we can eventually stop using ones that cause harm to the environment.</li>
			            		<li>It allows for paperless communication through emails and online bill paying methods, which reduces deforestation.</li>

	            <h1>Analysis of Personal Information</h1>
	            <p>Data mining is commonly referred to the act of analysing one’s personal information using computer technology. Many organisations collect data about individuals, which is often shared with partner organisations. Whenever we check in on social media, the location and time are logged and similarly, whenever we take a picture with our phone’s camera the location and time are logged. Most of this data is stored and is accessible to various organisations. One way of recognising data mining is when a search for a product on online markets leads to recommendations for similar products and promotional contracts from organisations. Analysts sift through our personal information looking for patterns and opportunities. Mostly data mining is an automated process that searches for patterns in large data sets to predict events.</p>
	            <h2>Examples of the use of technology to analyse personal information:</h2>
	            <div class="examples">
		            <ul>
		            	<li>In business data mining is used to identify patterns to inform strategic business decisions. The data can be used to predict future sales, stock requirements and effective, targeted marketing strategies, which can improve business profitability.</li>
		            	<li>In engineering and science, data mining is used to analyse the human DNA sequences using collected medical information of patients, which has led to the development of effective treatment for various conditions.</li>
		            	<li>Most browsers analyse personal information of users in order to recommend them products and content similar to their searches.</li>
		            </ul>

	        	<div  class="or">
	        		<div class="tables">
	        			<h3>Opportunities:</h3>
	        			<div class="examples">
		        			<ul>
				            	<li>Data mining is an effective tool for fighting against organised crime and terrorism as data about individual activities, such as social media use, travel, financial transactions, shared contact details and internet history, can provide valuable information to prevent crime.</li>
			            		<li>Companies can increase their profits using data mining by targeting products to individuals based on their search histories.</li>

	        			<h3>Risks:</h3>
	        			<div class="examples">
		        			<ul>
				            	<li>Use of technology to analyse personal information can become a breach of privacy as companies can easily implement data mining techniques that can steal personal information of customers, such as credit card details and addresses.</li>
			            		<li>Data mining can potentially lead to data abuse, which involves stealing and selling of one's personal information, causing phishing.</li>

	            <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
	            <p>Expert systems or intelligent knowledge-based systems are examples of artificial intelligence, which can perform at a similar level to human experts in certain areas. Artificial intelligence systems are based on neural networks, which emulate the structure of the human brain. These systems can apply what they have learnt when the data is changed. They use pattern recognition to determine the nature of objects or situations and compare these with stored information about similar objects and situations. However, intelligence is more than pattern recognition. Creativity, social intelligence and our ability to interact with others defines intelligence. Chatbots, such as Eliza, respond to typed comments by identifying keywords. However, sometimes sophisticated chatbots are used as malware to obtain personal information. The Turing test, devised by Alan Turing, questions the intelligence of computers by asking "Can a computer fool an interrogator into thinking it is a human being?"</p>

	            <div class="examples">
		            <ul>
		            	<li>Speech recognition systems identify keywords and patterns in the spoken word to interpret the meaning.</li>
		            	<li>Chess-playing programs that can analyse millions of possible alternative scenarios to make a move.</li>
		            	<li>Medical diagnosis systems are used to self-diagnose illness from the symptoms and to support medical staff in making correct diagnosis.</li>
		            	<li>Credit-card checking that looks for unusual patterns in credit-card use to identify potential frauds.</li>

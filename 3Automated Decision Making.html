	            <h1>Automated Decision Making</h1>
	            <p>The principle of computers analysing data to make decisions is what automated decision-making is about. It is best deployed in situations where decisions must be made frequently and rapidly based on electronic evidence. The quality of decisions depends on several factors, including the accuracy of data, predictability of situations and the quality of the algorithm. The computer applies the algorithm and makes the decision based on the data collected. However, it doesn’t question the decisions made or the accuracy of the data.</p>
	            <h2>Examples of the use of technology for automated decision making:</h2>
	            <div class="examples">
		            <ul>
		            	<li>Stock market trading, also known as algorithmic or automated trading, involves computers making decisions about buying and selling stocks based on various parameters.</li>
		            	<li>Algorithms are used in some medical treatments, by applying machine learning to predict a patient’s health based on collected information.</li>
		            	<li>Automated systems are used by examination boards to mark multiple choice tests. Systems are pre-programmes with the number of correct answers required to get a certain grade.</li>
		            	<li>Credit assessments in banks.</li>
		            </ul>

	        			<h3>Opportunities:</h3>
	        			<div class="examples">
		        			<ul>
				            	<li>Organisations can benefit by using automated systems in many sectors, such as healthcare, education and marketing as they lead to quicker and more consistent decisions.</li>
			            		<li>Most times proper decisions can be made where a large volume of data needs to be analysed and decisions need to be made quickly.</li>

				            	<li>The use of automated systems is often invisible to individuals, which can lead to privacy issues.</li>
			            		<li>Computer crashes caused by unreliable algorithms can cause major losses of money or, even worse, cost lives.</li>
